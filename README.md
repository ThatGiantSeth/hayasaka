## Information
Hayasaka is being developed as a private bot for a private server. The source code can be downloaded and self hosted, but some commands are server specific (and/or user specific). Another reason you may want to avoid using this bot in your own server is that it has almost no use besides our server-tailored commands. 

If you really still want to use this bot in your own server, I've created a guide on the [wiki](https://github.com/ThatGiantSeth/hayasaka/wiki), which will teach you the basics of changing some files, creating and using a MongoDB database, working with environment varables, and other stuff you need to run this bot.

## Using The Bot (for people in our server)
A list of commands can be found by typing t.help in the server OR in the bot's DMs. Alternatively there's a (probably incomplete) list of commands [here](https://github.com/ThatGiantSeth/hayasaka/wiki/Commands).

## Contact
I'm afraid I can't offer much support for self hosting beyond the guide in the wiki section, as it's far beyond my original scope of a hobby for my server with the boys, but if you come across any errors or other issues with the guide, you can DM me on Discord @ ThatGiantSeth#0002.

**Thanks!**
