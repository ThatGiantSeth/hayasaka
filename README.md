## Information
Hayasaka is being developed as a private bot for a private server. The source code can be downloaded and self hosted, but some commands are server specific (and/or user specific). Another reason you may want to avoid using this bot in your own server is that it has almost no use besides our server-tailored commands. 

## Using The Bot (for people in our server)
A list of commands can be found by typing t.help in the server OR in the bot's DMs.

## Contact
I'm afraid I can't offer much support for self hosting, as it's far beyond my original scope of a hobby for my server with the boys, I may occasionally answer questions in the issues section. No guarantees though.

**Thanks!**
